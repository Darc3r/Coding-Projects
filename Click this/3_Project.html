          <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication"> domestic</a> <b>dog</b> (<i>Canis
              familiaris when considered a separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species">species</a> or Canis
              lupus familiaris when
              considered a subspecies of the wolf</i>)
            is a wolf-like canid and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
            The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, as modern wolves are not closely related to
            the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog
            is extinct. </p>

            The dog was the first species to be domesticated by hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago, which
            predates
            agriculture.
            Since then, the dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities and
            physical attributes.
            Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they can thrive
            on a
            starch-rich
            diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

          <h2> Taxonomy </h2>

          <p> In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the binomial
            nomenclature
            – or the two-word naming – of species. Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",and under this genus, he listed
            the
            dog-like
            carnivores, including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as Canis
            familiaris, and on
            the
            next page, he classified the wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from
            the wolf
            because of its cauda recurvata - its upturning tail, which is not found in any other canid.

          <h3> Anatomy</h3>

          <p>
            Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities and
            physical
            attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance and behavior than any other domestic
            animal. Dogs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"> predators</a> and<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger">
              scavengers </a> ; like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles,
            large and sharp claws and teeth, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting
            and endurance and teeth for catching and tearing.

          <h4> Size and weight </h4>
          Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier that
          stood only 6.3 centimetres (2 1⁄2 inches) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3 3⁄4 in) in length along the
          head-and-body and weighed only 113 grams (4 ounces). The most massive known dog was a Saint
          Bernard, which weighed 167.6 kg (369 1⁄2 lb) and was 250 cm (8 ft 2 in) from the snout to
          the tail.[29] The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (3 ft 6 in) at the shoulder.

          <h4> Senses </h4>
          <p>
            The dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch and sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field.
            Another study suggested that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field.

          <h4> Coat </h4>
          Main article: Coat (dog)
          <p>
            Dogs display a wide variation on coat type, density, length, color and composition
            The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being familiar with dogs
            (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard
            hair and a soft down hair, or "single," with the topcoat only. Breeds may have
            an occasional "blaze," stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.
